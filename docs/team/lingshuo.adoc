== Project: Bamboo
Bamboo is a desktop address book application developed as part of a Software Engineering module requirement.
The target audience is students or possibly business people as Bamboo provides an easy but efficient approach to
manage contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java,
and has about 22 kLoC.

=== Enhancement Added: Group Function & Find Function

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

// tag::add[]
=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book +
Format: `add n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...` +
Alias: `a`

[TIP]
A person must have 1 name +
A person can have 0 or 1 phone number, email and address +
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe` +
Add person `John Doe` with empty phone, email and address as `---`
* `add n/John Doe p/71625387` +
Add person `John Doe` with phone `71625387`
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` +
Add `John Doe` with all fields
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal` +
Add `Betsy Crowe` and the following fields with a tag `Criminal`
// end::add[]

// tag::find[]
=== Locating persons by name, address, email or phone number: `find` (Since V1.4)

Finds persons whose names or name initials or address or phone number or email contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find [n/] [p/] [e/] [a/] [t/] KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` +
Alias: `f`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The search can be done with initials. e.g. `AY` will match `Alex Yeoh`
* The search can be done with partial strings. e.g. `Ber` will match `Bernice Yu`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Persons can be searched by name, phone number, email or address.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`
* `find AY` +
Returns `Alex Yeoh` whose name initial is `AY`
* `find Ber` +
Returns `Bernice Yu` whose name contains the partial string `Ber`
* `find p/83537423` +
Returns any person with phone number `83537423`
* `find a/earth` +
Returns any person with address containing `earth`
* `find e/gmail` +
Returns any person with email containing keyword `gmail`
* `find t/friends` +
Returns any person with tags containing keyword `friends`
// end::find[]

==== Justification

* Enhancing find functions is essential for a large size address book. By allowing multiple ways of finding,
users could actually access the contacts by remembering anything, names, emails, address... and even
partial name searching is supported

* Enhancing add functions has great practical value for users. Normally users do not have every detail of their contacts.
Normally, people may want to save their contact with limited knowledge of their phones, emails and addresses.
Especially for students and business people, adding a person with missing field is convenient and require less for users.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

// tag::find[]
=== Finding
The finding mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand`, which extends `Command`.
It supports finding a list of specific persons by entering any substring of a person's contact field.
This includes a person's name, phone number, email, address or even their tags with `PREFIX` specified. +

The sequence diagram below details the flow the execution of a `find p/1` command.

image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Finding a person is facilitated using `PartialSearchUtil`, which examines whether a base list contains any word whose
substring appears in the target list. It maps each attribute to the `find` parser and returns a list of persons
matching find condition.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `find` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Find person by a list of substrings or name initials +
**Pros:** Easy and neat for implementation +
A lot of real user case shows finding by substring and name initials are prevailing among users +
**Cons:** Unable to handle typo mistakes and order mistakes +
**Alternative 2:** Perform fuzzy search by editing distance +
**Pros:** Able to fix typos and order mistakes +
**Cons:** Slow in running and hard to implement +
Partial string will have a big editing distance.

// end::find[]

// tag::add[]
=== Adding
The finding mechanism is facilitated by `AddCommand`, which extends `Command`.
It supports adding a person into address book with name, and alternative fields phone, email, address and tag
Missing field with be displayed as `---` +

The sequence diagram below details the flow the execution of a `add n/Lingshuo` command.

image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

This functionality is supported by requiring only name in argMultimap. +
Other empty field among email, address and phone number will be marked with name of `---`

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `add` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** once detect a missing field in arguMultimap for phone, address or email,
create the corresponding field with a false name of `---` +
**Pros:** Easy and neat for implementation +
Low coupling with other parts of the program +
**Cons:** Not good for future detection and correction of missing fields +
**Alternative 2:** replace required field phone, email and address in Person model with Optional +
**Pros:** Standard implementation and implement the missing of the fields properly +
**Cons:** SHigh coupling with other classes +
Not user friendly on UI.

// end::add[]

=== Enhancement Proposed: Generate QR code for adding person

Support generating QR code for existing contacts. Scanning the QR code will generate add command
instructions for another user. This enhancement would increase the interactive functionality between users.
