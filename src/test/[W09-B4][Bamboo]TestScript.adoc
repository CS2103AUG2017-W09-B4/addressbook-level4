= `[W09-B4] [Bamboo]` Test Script

== Loading of sample data file
The sample data file `[W09-B4][Bamboo]SampleData.xml` is inside the `test` folder, the same folder as this test script. +

. Create a new empty folder named `data` within the same folder with `Bamboo.jar` file.
. Copy the `SampleData.xml` into the `data` folder.
. Rename the data file as `addressbook.xml`.

== Explanation on user interface

. The menu bar on top contains `File` and `Help`.
. There are three panels - Contacts, Groups and Person Details
. The leftmost panel shows the list of contacts present in Bamboo.
. The middle panel shows the Groups present in Bamboo.
. The rightmost panel shows the details of the person. (Eg. Name, Email, Schedule)

Now we will manually test the functionality in groups.
